### Questions:
1. Please explain when we must use an array or linked list. Better explain the tradeoff between them. 
2. Assume that the maximum number of balls is 10,000 and the sequence starts with 100 balls. In this case, the maximum number of balls is fixed, but the operation needed is explained below. Is it still good to use arrays ?
- There is a sequence of balls. I can insert a ball anywhere in the sequence. I can retrieve the whole sequence of balls. Which data structure that I will use ? 
- Ex. When I have a ball with number 1 to 100. Then I insert a ball number 101 between 55 and 56. Then the sequence of balls would be 1, 2, 3, ..., 55, 101, 56, ..., 100.
