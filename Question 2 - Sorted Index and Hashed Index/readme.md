### Questions:
1. Please explain the sorted index and hashed index in the database. Better explain the tradeoff between them.
2. Ex. If there is a table consisting of user_id, age, height, and gender. You want to query in that table by user_id, like `SELECT user_id FROM table WHERE user_id = 1`
3. Ex. If you want to query in that table by age range, like `SELECT user_id FROM table WHERE age > 15 AND age < 60` Which index is better on the problems above ?
